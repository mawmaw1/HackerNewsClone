## Introduction
#### 1. Purpose of the system

To create a reddit-like platform where users can share links and 
have discussions about technology and software in general. Users 
must sign up to use the system and that information will be 
sold to third parties.

#### 2. Scope of the system

Users of the site submit content in the form of links or text-posts. 
The content of the site is either up- or downvoted by the users. Users 
generate ‘karma-points’ when their content is upvoted. Users may only 
downvote content, when they have accumulated 500 points. 

#### 3. Objectives and success criteria of the project

Have a fully functional application deployed on a server, reachable 
to the public, with more than 95% uptime.

## Proposed system
#### 1. Overview
#### 2. Functional Requirements

- To access all functionality on the application, users can create an account.
- When logged in, users can see their post/comment history and additional information
  about their usage of the site.
- Users can access an inbox with messages and message other users.
- Users can view posts.
- Users can downvote or upvote (if they are eligible) the posts of other users.

#### 3. Nonfunctional Requirements
###### a. Usability

The application should work on the latest 2 versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox 
and Edge. The sites content should dynamically scale to fit the screen of a 
mobile or tablet device.

###### b. Reliability

The application should have an uptime of at least 95%. During maintenance, 
incoming posts should be buffered and stored as soon as the application 
is running again.

###### c. Performance

When opening the application via browser, the view should be rendered 
completely with visible posts within 1.5 seconds. This system must be 
satisfying to use on different hardware. Old phones, tablet and computers 
must be able to use the site without too much lag and long load times. 

###### d. Supportability

The system should be able to be easily maintained, serviced and tested.

###### e. Implementaition
###### f. Interface
###### g. Packaging
###### h. Legal

All users must agree to our terms of service. We will without a doubt 
abuse all information we recieve. All information will be sold - even 
passwords. We cannot be held accountable for any problems that occur 
due to this. (this might be satirical, as we weren't sure what to 
write here)
